    	One of the organizations we're donating money to this year is <a href="http://www.foodforfree.org/" target="_blank">Food for Free</a>. On Feb. 25, they will be leading a discussion about hunger in Cambridge and what their organization does to help. Check back for 
        more details.

    	Sales are going to happen a bit differently this semester. Instead of having a sales table 
        on Friday, challah will be delivered to your dorm on Thursday evenings, or will be available 
        for pickup at the Student Center on Friday between 1:30 and 2:00 pm. 
        If you want to buy challah, use this <a href="orderform.php">online order form</a>. Orders are due by noon on Thursday.

        Photos from our massive mini-challah baking adventure can be found <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/101403097574335733899/albums/5838995487004891809" target="_new">here</a>.

    <p>We're looking for new people to join our exec team! If you'd like to play a greater role in CfH - whether it be leading dough making sessions, planning large events, tracking our sales, etc. - now's the time to start! Please reply to cfh-exec@mit.edu if you're interested in learning more about open positions. If you've never made dough or baked before, we're also looking for people who can do the more behind-the-scenes business. Not sure what you want to do? Let us know you're interested, and we can help figure out a good role for you!

    <p>We're always looking for new flavors of challah to try. In addition to plain and Nutella, 
    we have done apple-cinnamon, garlic-herb, cinnamon sugar, and mint chocolate, just to name a few. 
    Feel free to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEl6dmlIcFphTlJUdHBKcTNMT21tUXc6MQ#gid=0" target="_blank">suggest new flavors here</a>. </p>
