        <h1>Baking and Sales</h1>        
        <p>
        	We generally bake on Thursday evenings.  
        </p>
        <h2>Baking </h2>
        <p>
        	We bake on Thursdays in the Next House Country Kitchen. 
            Dough making begins at 5:00 pm and consists of mixing the flour, water, yeast, and 
            other ingredients, and then kneading the dough. Baking starts at 7:00 pm, where we 
            fill and braid the loaves and bake them. 
        </p>
        <h2>Sales </h2>
        <p>
        	We sell challah through a <a href="orderform.php">pre-order/order form</a> system. 
            The form is released early in the week, allowing you to reserve a loaf of challah. 
            Your challah will be delivered to your dorm on Thursday evening, or you can pick it 
            up at the Next House Country Kitchen during baking hours. Each week, we have to limit 
            the number of challah orders we take based on the number of volunteers we have. This 
            semester, however, we will have a <a href="orderform.php">wait list</a> 
            for challah orders, so you may be able to 
            get a loaf if we have extras. 
        </p>
