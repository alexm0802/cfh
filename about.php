        <h1>About Us</h1>
        
        <p>Challah for Hunger (CfH) is a national club with chapters all over the US that produces and sells
challah, a type of bread, on a regular basis to raise funds for and increase awareness of hunger.</p>

<p>The volunteers here at MIT gather on a weekly basis to make challah from scratch, which we
sell to the MIT community. This chapter produces challah in a variety of flavors: plain, Nutella,
garlic-herb, cinnamon sugar, mint chocolate, and wherever else our
imagination leads us. We donate fifty percent of our profits to the national CfH cause--MAZON, as do the other chapters.  The remaining
fifty percent is donated to local charity organizations upon which the club members
decide. </p>
 
<p>The MIT chapter of CfH is entirely student run and provides students with many opportunities
including baking, addressing humanitarian problems, and learning skills such as marketing and
leadership. One of the main goals of CfH is to empower young adults aware of
the suffering around the world who want change it through business and social justice. CfH is
committed to making a difference as a community through the production of challah, respect and
awareness, professional behavior, and opportunities for those who seek to learn more about
Judaism or challah. </p>

<p> Challah for Hunger is a 501(c)(3) non-profit. </p>
