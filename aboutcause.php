        <h2>MAZON</h2>
        <p><a href="http://mazon.org/" target="_blank">MAZON</a> is a California-based nonprofit that focuses on ending
hunger in the United States and Israel. To make nutritious
food available for those in need, MAZON supports food
banks, emergency food providers, synagogues, and other
local organizations so they can enact change in their own
communities. MAZON also works to raise awareness and
educate the Jewish community about hunger and its causes. </p>

	<h2>Food For Free</h2>
    <p>
    	<a href="http://www.foodforfree.org/" target="_blank">Food For Free</a> is a local, Cambridge-based nonprofit that
rescues fresh food and food that might otherwise go to waste,
and distributes it within the local emergency food system
where it can reach those in need. Their programs address
not only short-term hunger, but obesity, diet-related disease,
and other long-term health effects of food insecurity and
poor nutrition.
