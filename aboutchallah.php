        <p>Challah is a braided bread typically eaten to celebrate Jewish holidays. One such holiday is Shabbat,
which occurs every Friday night. On Shabbat, two loaves of challah are eaten as a reminder of the
double portion of manna that came to the Israelites from heaven during the 40 years that they
wandered in the wilderness. Currently, challah is thought of as a symbol for unity. Each of the
strands of challah represents a different area of our life. On Shabbat, we pull ourselves together and
reflect on the past week as we unify our soul with our body.</p>
